# DC 5: marine biodiversity prediction

## Task description

Predicting the abundance of multiple taxa (reef fishes and plankton) as well as categories of marine particulate matter across the ocean using socio-environmental predictors (e.g., physical and biogeochemical ocean variables delivered by operational products, descriptors of the habitats and of socio-economic activities such as fishing pressure).
Once tested and validated using independent observations, the models will be used to extrapolate the spatiotemporal distribution of these taxa in unobserved parts of the ocean.
