# DC 2: probabilistic short-term forecasting of upper ocean dynamics

## Task description

Probabilistic short-term (a few tens of days) forecasting of upper ocean dynamics (scalar and vector fields) from gridded satellite-derived data (2D+T and sparsely sampled fields) and ARGO float data (sets of vertical profiles).
