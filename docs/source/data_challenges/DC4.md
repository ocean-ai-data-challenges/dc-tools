# DC 4: forecasting tropical cyclones

## Task description

With the objective of better understanding and forecasting the evolving structure of tropical cyclones (TCs) (radii, intensity, inflow circulation) and their interaction with the ocean during and after their passage (i.e. the TC wake signatures), participants will exploit various observations co-located with TC tracks in order to estimate ocean-atmosphere parameters such as surface winds, waves, sea surface height (SSH), sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), ocean colour and upper ocean SST and SSS, during the TC lifecycle.

Three subtasks will be explored, using different observation windows to estimate the variables at time $t$:

1. Filtering: $\left[t - \infty, t \right)$
2. Smoothing: $\left(t - \infty, t + \infty \right)$
3. Forecasting: $\left(t - inf, t-24h\right]$
